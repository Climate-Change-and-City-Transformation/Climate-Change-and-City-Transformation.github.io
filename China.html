                   Depth into Carbon Dioxide Emission in China

                China is one of the largest carbon dioxide emission countries. In 2017, it released 9.8 billion tons carbon dioxide. 
                Most of China's carbon dioxide emissions come from fossil fuels, esopecially from the coal (70% of total energy comes from
                coal). 
            </p>
            <p class="mid-text">
                To look deep into the relationships among carbon dioxide emission, economic structures, geographical elements and 
                population in China, we first need to understand current emission pattern at the level of province or city, and how it 
                transformed from 2000 to 2016 (when the development of economy in China was relatively higher than any period since 1978).
                This analysis could give us a initial but relatively detailed cognition of where contributed more emission than other places.

            <div class="rough-box">
                <p class="text">
                    So, the first question is: Where are carbon dioxide emissions higher than the average in China?
