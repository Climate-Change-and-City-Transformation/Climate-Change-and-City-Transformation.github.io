                   Depth into Carbon Dioxide Emission in China

            </h2>
            <p class="mid-text">
                Our climate has been affected deeply by the emission of carbon dioxide for a very long time. Recent years, China has 
                become one of the largest carbon dioxide emission countries . In 2017, it released 9.8 billion tons carbon dioxide. 
                Most of China's carbon dioxide emissions come from fossil fuels, esopecially from the coal (70% of total energy 
                comes from coal). 
            </p>
            <p class="mid-text">
                To look deep into the relationships among carbon dioxide emission, economic structures, geographical elements and 
                population in China, we first need to understand current emission pattern at the level of province or city, and how it 
                transformed from 2000 to 2016 (when the development of economy in China was relatively higher than any period since 1978).
                This analysis could give us a initial but relatively detailed cognition of where contributed more emission than other places.

            <div class="rough-box">
                <p class="text">
                    So, the first question is: Where are carbon dioxide emissions higher than the average in China?

                            relatively more carbon dioxide annually. But some provinces(Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Heibei,) that

                The carbon dioxide emission pattern has been displayed above. Next, we want to know how this pattern 
                came into being.Based on the above analysis, we know that core cities in China made a more contribution 
                to the emission of carbon dioxide.Also because the original, well-prepared transformation dataset of China 
                cities' carbon emission

                we used focuses on 50 cities, and most of them are the core cities of China, it is appropriate for us to 
                explore the changes of cities in the context of carbon dioxide emission.

                    volume grew and what sectors contributed more emissions in each city.This could help us understand what kinds of 
                    development path the cities choosed during this period.

                    The map below uses the annual volume of carbon dioxide emission in each city as the variable of the white circles.
                    As time went by, the most noticeable regions were the East part (e.g. Yangtze Delta),South part (Pearl River Delta) 
                    and North part (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei) of China. If you click on the circles in the map, you might find that most of 
                    cities in these three areas emitted more carbon dioxide than that in any other cities in each year. Although some cities
                    may have similiar volume of carbon dioxide emissions, their structures of emission may have sighnificant differences.
                    Next graph could give us more information about the transformation of economic structures of emission in each city.

                    This graph shows us the structure of emission in each city. We choose primary industry, construction, transportation,
                    commercial, residents, and other industry as the analysis objects. The changes of ratio of emission volume among sectors in each 
                    city are relatively small, most of cities followed their previous path to develop. But we still could find some differences
                    if we make a comparison between cities. Taking Shenzhen and Guangzhou as an example, both of them are the largest cities
                    in China. But their emission structure is different. The commercial sector in Guangzhou covered a large percentage
                    of emission annually. But Shenzhen is relatively more balanced.

                    So far, we have already talked about the spatial pattern of carbon dioxide emission and the 
                    transformation of 50 cities' emission sectors. Next, we will combine the population, GDP, 
                    region information, carbon dioxide emission data together, to see what kind of division of cities
                    came into being as time went by.

                    So, the last question: Is their any geographical differences among China cities when considering the 
                    relationships between GDP and emission volume?

                    If you’re familiar with the geography and climates of China, you might know that the cities which are
                    at the North of Qinling-Huaihe Line, will be regarded as the North cities. Most of North cities uses
                    coal as major energy to heat and generate the electricity. Some heavy industries, such as Metal smelter,
                    also prefer to distributing in the North, because of the geographical proximity to natural resources.
                    These reasons resulted in more emission in North China.

                    We still focus on the 50 cities we mentioned before.The above graph shows the distribution of cities 
                    in the GDP-Total Carbon dioxide Emission context. The division pattern of cities emerged as time went by.
                    In 2016, there were 10 North cities above the trend line, covering more than 70% of total cities which were 
                    above this line. All of cities in the South of China were below the trend line, and the majority of cities
                    from East and West were same as South cities. This distribution means that South cities could produce 
                    more economic outputs, compared with North cities, under the same carbon dioxide emission.
                    This graph clearly shows when the division between South and North is explicit and what kind of pattern it is.

                    In this section, we mainly focus on the carbon dioxide emission topic in China, where the emission has already 
                    become the largest one. Carbon dioxide emission has affected almost all aspects of our life and environment, such as 
                    temperature, sea level, and the distribution of species. It is crucial for us to continue working on analysis of the 
                    current emission spatial pattern, future trends and its impacts.
